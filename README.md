# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY-USING-LSB-AND-DCT
In this project we introduce an algorithm of digital image steganography  based on Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). According to the characters of human vision, in this algorithm, the information of digital watermarking which has been discrete Cosine transformed, is put into the high frequency band of the image
